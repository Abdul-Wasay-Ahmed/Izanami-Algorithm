**IzanamiAlgorithm** is an enhanced, Izanami-inspired Node.js library designed to handle complex tasks with robust error monitoring and reflection mechanisms. Drawing inspiration from the **Izanami** genjutsu technique in the Naruto series, this algorithm not only manages retries for failed tasks but also enforces a reflection phase to encourage introspection and improvement after encountering repeated errors.

## Features

- **Configurable Retry Mechanism**: Set maximum attempts and implement exponential backoff.
- **Reflection Phase**: Analyze and respond to recurring errors with customizable strategies.
- **Persistent Logging**: Logs all errors to a file for comprehensive analysis.
- **Event-Driven**: Integrate seamlessly with other systems using event emitters.
- **Customizable**: Tailor reflection strategies and error handling to fit your needs.
- **Extensible**: Easily extend the algorithm for various complex task scenarios.
